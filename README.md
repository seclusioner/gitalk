# Gitalk Introduction

Gitalk is a comment system based on GitHub Issues, which allows you to easily integrate a comment section into your website. Gitalk uses GitHub as a backend to store comments, which means you don't need to worry about database management, and you can leverage GitHub's powerful features (such as authentication, Markdown support, etc.).

## Features
- **Based on GitHub Issues**: Each page corresponds to a GitHub issue as the comment section.
- **Easy to use**: No need to set up additional backend services, just configure the GitHub repository.
- **Supports Markdown syntax**: Allows formatting comments using Markdown for better readability.
- **Authentication**: Uses GitHub login for authentication, ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the comment section.
